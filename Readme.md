# Android App Market Analysis - Google Play Store

## Introduction
In this project, we will perform a comprehensive analysis of the Android app market by comparing thousands of apps available on the Google Play store. The analysis will cover various aspects such as app size, ratings, number of reviews, and more.

### Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of Android app data scraped from the Google Play Store in 2018 by Lavanya Gupta. The dataset contains thousands of apps and their respective reviews.

## Challenges Addressed

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
    - How many rows and columns does the dataset have?
    - Removed unused columns (`Last_Updated`, `Android_Version`).
    - Identified and removed NaN values in the `Rating` column.
    - Found and removed duplicates from the dataset.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
    - Identified the highest-rated apps.
    - Found the largest apps in terms of size (MB).
    - Discovered the apps with the most reviews.
    - Analyzed content ratings using pie and donut charts.

3. **Numeric Type Conversion**
    - Converted the `Installs` column to a numeric type.
    - Investigated apps with over 1 billion installations.

4. **Revenue Estimation**
    - Estimated revenue for paid apps by multiplying price with the number of installs.
    - Filtered out apps that cost more than $250.

5. **Data Visualization**
    - Created various bar and scatter plots to visualize app categories, competition, and download concentration.

6. **Genre Analysis**
    - Explored app genres and created visualizations for the top genres in the market.
  
7. **Free vs Paid App Analysis**
    - Investigated free and paid apps using grouped bar charts.
